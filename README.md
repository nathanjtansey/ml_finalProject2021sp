# ml_finalProject2021sp

This was a regression project I completed for a machine learning class in my final semester of undergrad, Spring 2021. 

In this project I sought to estimate the associated effect on Total Value Added from eight different features: total employment, total payroll, total value of shipments, total cost of materials, total capital expenditure, total real capital stock, end of year inventories, and cost of electricity & fuels. The files in this repo show both the data analysis and wrangling methods used, as well as the training of several machine learning algorithms.
